BlogParser
----------

This is a mechanize script aimed to scrape and backup some
of my music blogs sharing the same format.

Disclaimer:
Contains irresponsible, untested code.
Does the trick though :-)

Usage:

```bash
./scraper http://some_blog.io
```

A run with no errors will leave behind a `songs.db`
